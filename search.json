    "text": "Is it without reason that God chooses to be identified with certain men more than others? It is true that “God is no respecter of persons,” so that “in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him”. Acts 10:34. To every faithful child of His He says, “I [am] the LORD thy God”. Exodus 20:2. But it is also true that He identifies Himself more closely with some men than with others. By association He is more the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob than of anyone else (). As well he was the God of Israel than of any other nation (). It was by a covenant that He became the God of Israel and when they broke the covenant He divorced them. Therefore this assocition with God is only gained and maintained by faithfulness.\nThis is true also for the relationship between Christ and God. In the first chapter of Hebrews, because Jesus Christ “loved righteousness, and hated iniquity” (verse 9), God says to Him that He is God, “even thy(Christ’s) God”. The full verse reads, “Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore God, [even] thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness above thy fellows.” Christ came to this world a fallible human being of the seed of fallible Abraham. (Heb. 2:16) In nature He could be no better than Abraham. And had he sinned in any particular, God would have ceased being His God.\nThere is one person that\nLuke 1:32 He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: \nThe throne is given to him by one greater. (Heb. 7:7) John 14:28\nFrom which tribe was Christ to Come??
